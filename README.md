# Double-Down Controller

Learning the concepts of a Kubernetes controller by creating a simple one myself!

## Description

A very simple controller which watches for the `jdocklabs.co.uk/double-down: 'true'` annotation on a `Deployment` object and doubles the number
of replicas in it, thereby doubling down.

We avoid continually doubling the number of pods by using the `jdocklabs.co.uk/doubled: 'true'` annotation.
If this is found, we do nothing.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

To test this out, you can run the following

```bash
make run

# In another terminal, create a deployment with 2 replicas
kubectl create deployment double-down-nginx --image nginx --replicas 2

# Verify the number of replicas
kubectl get deployments.apps double-down-nginx -o jsonpath='{.spec.replicas}{"\n"}'

# Annotate the Deployment
kubectl annotate deployments.apps double-down-nginx 'jdocklabs.co.uk/double-down=true'

# Verify the number of replicas again, now 4 is expected.
kubectl get deployments.apps double-down-nginx -o jsonpath='{.spec.replicas}{"\n"}'
```

You can also accomplish the same using a Kubernetes manifest, but this is shown step-by-step for understanding.


### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster.
